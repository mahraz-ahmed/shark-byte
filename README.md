## The idea

Students are already carrying an NFC-enabled university ID card. SharkByte turns every tap — attending a lecture, checking into a society event — into a gamified action. Show up consistently, earn badges, climb the leaderboard. Engagement becomes visible and rewarding without any extra apps or hardware for the student.

## Gamification

Every tap earns XP and contributes to a streak. The leaderboard is live and updates in real time via SSE.

| Action                     | XP                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Attend a lecture           | +10                      |
| Be the first to arrive     | +25 (+ Early Bird badge) |
| Check into a society event | +15                      |
| 3-day attendance streak    | +20 bonus                |
| 7-day streak               | +50 bonus                |
| 30-day streak              | +200 bonus               |
| Reach 100 XP               | Century badge            |
| Break into top 10          | Top 10 badge             |
| Attend 5+ events           | Society Star badge       |

Streaks reset if a student misses a day. Best streak is tracked separately so past effort is preserved.

## What it does

Students tap their existing Mifare Classic university ID card on any SharkByte device (ESP32 + NFC reader). The system resolves who tapped and what the device is configured for, then performs the appropriate action and pushes a live update to the dashboard.

| Mode           | Action                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attendance** | Marks the student present, awards XP, updates streak |
| **Event**      | Checks the student into a society event, awards XP   |
| **Equipment**  | Checks out / returns lab equipment                   |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB running locally on port 27017

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/SharkByte
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...          # for OTP emails
```

Seed the database:

```bash
python seed.py
```

Run the server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5173`. Vite proxies `/api` → `localhost:5000`.
